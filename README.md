# Forever Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal repository for tracking learning resources related to programming and software development. This repository serves as a curated list of books, courses, and other valuable learning materials that I've found helpful in my journey as a developer.

The primary goal of maintaining this repository is to create a centralized place where I can keep track of my ongoing learning journey and organize my resources. I also aspire for this collection to become a valuable resource for other developers, providing them with a diverse range of materials to enhance their skills and knowledge.
